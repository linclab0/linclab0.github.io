Rachel Ryskin is an Assistant Professor of Cognitive & Information Sciences at UC Merced. She wants to figure out what cognitive processes and computations enable humans to understand each other. In particular, she studies how learning and context-specific predictions help the human mind and brain deal with the noise and ambiguity present in everyday communication.
