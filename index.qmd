Language endows us with the ability to communicate the contents of our
mind with another person. But how do we decode another person's thoughts
and intentions from a sequence of sounds (speech) or shapes (letters,
signs)? This challenge seems compounded by the fact that transmission of
this sequence is often imperfect -- speakers and listeners make errors,
don't have the same prior knowledge, and sometimes even see different
things. Yet, communication with another person typically feels
effortless. In the Language, Interaction, & Cognition (LInC) Lab, we
take a cognitive (neuro)science approach to understanding how the human
language processing system extracts meaning from uncertain and variable
input. In particular, we investigate how learning and memory mechanisms
ground language understanding in the speaker and listener's
visuo-spatial and temporal contexts.
