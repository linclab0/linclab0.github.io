Language endows us with the ability to communicate the contents of our
mind with another person. But how do we decode another person's thoughts
and intentions from a sequence of sounds (speech) or shapes (letters,
signs)? This challenge seems compounded by the fact that transmission of
this sequence is often imperfect -- speakers and listeners make errors,
don't have the same prior knowledge, and sometimes even see different
things. Yet, communication with another person typically feels
effortless. In the Language, Interaction, & Cognition (LInC) Lab, we
take a cognitive science approach to understanding how the human
language processing system extracts meaning from uncertain and variable
input.
